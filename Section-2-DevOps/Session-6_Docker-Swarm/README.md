## 🎯 Service Types Deep Dive

### **🔁 Replicated Services**
```bash
# Create replicated service
docker service create --name web-app --replicas 3 -p 8080:80 nginx

# Scale service
docker service scale web-app=5

# Update service
docker service update --image nginx:latest web-app
```

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ **Specified replica count** - Run exact number of containers
- ✅ **Load balancing** - Traffic distributed across replicas
- ✅ **Scalable** - Easy to scale up or down
- ✅ **High availability** - Replicas spread across nodes

### **🌐 Global Services**
```bash
# Create global service
docker service create --name monitoring --mode global alpine:latest

# Global service examples
docker service create --name node-exporter --mode global prom/node-exporter
```

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ **One per node** - Runs on every cluster node
- ✅ **Automatic deployment** - New nodes get the service automatically
- ✅ **System services** - Perfect for monitoring, logging, security
- ✅ **Cluster-wide coverage** - Ensures complete cluster coverage

---

## 🏗️ Cluster Architecture

### **Manager Nodes:**
- **Cluster management** - Orchestration and scheduling
- **API endpoint** - Receive and process commands
- **Raft consensus** - Maintain cluster state
- **Certificate authority** - Manage cluster security

### **Worker Nodes:**
- **Container execution** - Run application containers
- **Task execution** - Execute scheduled tasks
- **Resource provision** - Provide CPU, memory, storage
- **Health reporting** - Report node and container status

---

## 🛠️ Essential Commands

### **Cluster Management:**
```bash
# Initialize swarm
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER-IP>

# Join as worker
docker swarm join --token <WORKER-TOKEN> <MANAGER-IP>:2377

# Join as manager
docker swarm join --token <MANAGER-TOKEN> <MANAGER-IP>:2377

# List nodes
docker node ls

# Inspect node
docker node inspect <NODE-ID>
```

### **Service Management:**
```bash
# Create service
docker service create --name <SERVICE-NAME> <IMAGE>

# List services
docker service ls

# Inspect service
docker service inspect <SERVICE-NAME>

# Scale service
docker service scale <SERVICE-NAME>=<REPLICAS>

# Update service
docker service update <SERVICE-NAME>

# Remove service
docker service rm <SERVICE-NAME>
```
