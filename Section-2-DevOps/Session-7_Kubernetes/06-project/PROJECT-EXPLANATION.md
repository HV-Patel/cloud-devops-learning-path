**🎯 Learn Kubernetes by Building a Real Application**

</div>

## 📚 What is This Project About?

This project teaches you Kubernetes by building a **complete Todo application** - just like the ones you use on your phone or computer! You'll learn how to:

- Deploy a **3-tier application** (Frontend + Backend + Database)
- Make different parts of your app **talk to each other**
- **Scale** your app when more people use it
- **Update** your app without breaking it
- **Fix problems** when things go wrong

Think of it like building a house with three rooms that need to work together!

## 🏗️ Understanding the Architecture (The Big Picture)

### 🏠 Our "Digital House" Has 3 Rooms:

```
👨‍💻 User (You!)
    ↓
🎨 Frontend Room (What you see)
    ↓
🔧 Backend Room (The brain)
    ↓
🗄️ Database Room (Memory storage)
```

### 🎨 **Room 1: Frontend (The Face of Our App)**
- **What it does**: Shows the pretty interface where you add/delete todos
- **Technology**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (like a website)
- **Real-world example**: Like the Instagram app on your phone - what you see and click

### 🔧 **Room 2: Backend/API (The Brain)**
- **What it does**: Handles all the logic - "Should I save this todo? Should I delete it?"
- **Technology**: Node.js (JavaScript running on a server)
- **Real-world example**: Like the smart part of Instagram that decides what photos to show you

### 🗄️ **Room 3: Database (The Memory)**
- **What it does**: Stores all your todos permanently
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL (like a super-organized filing cabinet)
- **Real-world example**: Like Instagram's storage that remembers all your photos

## 🤔 Why Do We Need Kubernetes?

### **The Problem Without Kubernetes:**
Imagine you have a restaurant (your app):
- 🍽️ You have 1 chef (backend), 1 waiter (frontend), 1 storage room (database)
- 😰 What if the chef gets sick? Restaurant closes!
- 😰 What if 100 customers come at once? Chaos!
- 😰 What if you want to update the menu? Close the restaurant!

### **The Solution With Kubernetes:**
Kubernetes is like a **super-smart restaurant manager**:
- 🎯 **Healing**: If a chef gets sick, automatically hire a new one
- 📈 **Scaling**: If more customers come, automatically add more chefs
- 🔄 **Updates**: Update the menu without closing the restaurant
- 🔧 **Management**: Keeps everything organized and running smoothly

## 🧩 Kubernetes Components Explained (Simple Terms)

### 🏷️ **Pod** = "A Box for Your App"
```
📦 Pod
├── 🎨 Your App (Frontend/Backend/Database)
├── 🌐 Network (IP address)
└── 💾 Storage (if needed)
```
- **Simple explanation**: A pod is like a box that holds your app
- **Real example**: Like a shipping container that holds your furniture

### 🚀 **Deployment** = "The Manager"
```
👨‍💼 Deployment Manager
├── 📦 Pod 1 (Frontend)
├── 📦 Pod 2 (Frontend) ← Backup!
└── 📦 Pod 3 (Frontend) ← More backup!
```
- **Simple explanation**: Makes sure you always have the right number of pods running
- **Real example**: Like a manager who makes sure you always have enough waiters in your restaurant

### 🌐 **Service** = "The Phone Number"
```
📞 Service (todo-frontend)
├── 📦 Pod 1 (Frontend)
├── 📦 Pod 2 (Frontend)
└── 📦 Pod 3 (Frontend)
```
- **Simple explanation**: Gives your app a permanent "phone number" so other apps can find it
- **Real example**: Like your home address - even if you rearrange furniture, people can still find your house

## 🎯 Project Structure Breakdown

### 📁 **What Files Do We Have?**

```
06-project/
├── 📄 todo-app-complete.yaml    ← Everything in one file (Easy!)
├── 📄 database.yaml             ← Just the database
├── 📄 api.yaml                  ← Just the backend
├── 📄 frontend.yaml             ← Just the frontend

```

### 🎯 **Two Ways to Deploy:**

#### **Option 1: The Easy Way (Recommended for beginners)**
```bash
# One command deploys everything!
kubectl apply -f todo-app-complete.yaml
```

#### **Option 2: Step by Step (Better for learning)**
```bash
# Deploy piece by piece to understand each part
kubectl apply -f database.yaml    # First: Set up storage
kubectl apply -f api.yaml         # Second: Set up brain
kubectl apply -f frontend.yaml    # Third: Set up interface
```

## 🚀 Let's Build It! (Step-by-Step Guide)

### **Step 1: Check Your Tools** 🔧
```bash
# Make sure you have kubectl (Kubernetes command tool)
kubectl version --client

# Make sure you can connect to your cluster
kubectl cluster-info

# If both work, you're ready! 🎉
```

### **Step 2: Navigate to Project** 📁
```bash
# Go to the project folder
cd /home/k8s/cloud-devops-learning-path/Section-2-DevOps/Session-7_Kubernetes/06-project

# See what files we have
ls -la
```

### **Step 3: Deploy the App** 🚀
```bash
# The magic command!
kubectl apply -f todo-app-complete.yaml

# Watch everything start up (like watching a movie!)
kubectl get pods -w
# Press Ctrl+C when all pods show "Running"
```

### **Step 4: Check Everything is Working** ✅
```bash
# See all your app components
kubectl get all -l project=todo-app

# Check if pods are healthy
kubectl get pods -l project=todo-app
```

### **Step 5: Access Your App** 🌐
```bash
# Your app is now running!
echo "🎉 Todo App: http://localhost:30080"
echo "🔧 API Health: http://localhost:30081/health"

# Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:30080
# Try adding some todos!
```

---

## 🧪 Fun Experiments to Try

### **Experiment 1: Scale Your App** 📈
```bash
# Make 3 copies of your frontend (like having 3 waiters)
kubectl scale deployment todo-frontend --replicas=3

# See your new pods
kubectl get pods -l app=todo-frontend

# Your app can now handle more users! 🎉
```

### **Experiment 2: Break Something and Watch It Fix Itself** 🔧
```bash
# Delete a pod (simulate a crash)
kubectl delete pod -l app=todo-frontend | head -1

# Watch Kubernetes create a new one automatically
kubectl get pods -l app=todo-frontend -w
# Press Ctrl+C when you see the new pod

# Your app is still working! Magic! ✨
```

### **Experiment 3: Check the Logs** 📋
```bash
# See what your app is saying
kubectl logs -l app=todo-api --tail=10

# See what your database is doing
kubectl logs -l app=todo-db --tail=10
```

### **Experiment 4: Test the API Directly** 🔧
```bash
# Test if your backend is healthy
curl http://localhost:30081/health

# See all your todos
curl http://localhost:30081/api/todos

# Add a todo via command line (like a hacker! 😎)
curl -X POST http://localhost:30081/api/todos \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Learn Kubernetes","completed":false}'
```

## 🔍 Understanding the YAML Files (Don't Worry, It's Simple!)

### **What is YAML?**
YAML is like a **recipe card** for Kubernetes. It tells Kubernetes:
- What to cook (what app to run)
- How many servings (how many copies)
- What ingredients (what resources needed)

### **Basic YAML Structure:**
```yaml
# This is a comment (like a note to yourself)
apiVersion: apps/v1          # Which Kubernetes recipe book to use
kind: Deployment             # What type of thing we're making
metadata:                    # Information about our thing
  name: todo-frontend        # What to call it
  labels:                    # Tags to organize it
    app: todo-frontend
spec:                        # The actual recipe
  replicas: 2                # Make 2 copies
  selector:                  # How to find our copies
    matchLabels:
      app: todo-frontend
  template:                  # Template for each copy
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: todo-frontend
    spec:
      containers:            # What to run in each copy
      - name: frontend
        image: nginx:1.21    # Which app to use
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80  # Which port to use
```

---

## 🚨 Common Problems and Solutions

### **Problem 1: Pods Not Starting**
```bash
# Check what's wrong
kubectl describe pod -l project=todo-app

# Common causes:
# - Wrong image name
# - Not enough resources
# - Network issues
```

### **Problem 2: Can't Access the App**
```bash
# Check if services are running
kubectl get services -l project=todo-app

# Check if ports are correct
kubectl describe service todo-frontend
```

### **Problem 3: Database Connection Issues**
```bash
# Check database logs
kubectl logs -l app=todo-db

# Check if database is ready
kubectl get pods -l app=todo-db
```

### **Problem 4: App Not Working After Changes**
```bash
# Check recent events
kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp | tail -10

# Restart everything
kubectl rollout restart deployment/todo-frontend
kubectl rollout restart deployment/todo-api
kubectl rollout restart deployment/todo-db
```

---

## 🧹 Clean Up When You're Done

```bash
# Remove everything (like cleaning your room)
kubectl delete -f todo-app-complete.yaml

# Check everything is gone
kubectl get all -l project=todo-app

# Should show "No resources found" ✅
```
