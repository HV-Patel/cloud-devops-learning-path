# Section 2: DevOps & Infrastructure as Code

## 🎯 Section Overview

This section focuses on DevOps practices, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and automation tools. You'll learn how to manage infrastructure programmatically, implement CI/CD pipelines, and adopt DevOps best practices.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

### Core DevOps Concepts:
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles
- Version control for infrastructure
- Automated provisioning and deployment
- Configuration management
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Monitoring and observability

### Tools & Technologies:
- **Terraform** - Infrastructure provisioning
- **Git** - Version control
- **AWS CLI** - Command-line interface
- **Docker** - Containerization
- **Jenkins/GitHub Actions** - CI/CD pipelines
- **Ansible** - Configuration management

### AWS Services for DevOps:
- **CloudFormation** - AWS native IaC
- **CodePipeline** - CI/CD service
- **CodeBuild** - Build service
- **CodeDeploy** - Deployment service
- **Systems Manager** - Operations management
- **CloudWatch** - Monitoring and logging

## 📁 Current Sessions

### Terraform Module
- **Focus:** Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- **Project:** Automated EC2 + Nginx deployment
- **Skills:** Terraform syntax, state management, best practices

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Completion of Section 1 (Cloud Fundamentals)
- Basic programming/scripting knowledge
- Understanding of version control (Git)
- AWS CLI configured
- Terraform installed

## 🎓 Learning Path

```
IaC Fundamentals → Terraform Basics → Advanced Terraform → CI/CD → Monitoring
```

## 📈 Skill Progression

- Create custom automation tools
- Optimize performance and costs

## 🔧 Development Environment Setup

### Required Tools:
1. **AWS CLI** - AWS command-line interface
2. **Terraform** - Infrastructure provisioning
3. **Git** - Version control
4. **VS Code** - Code editor (recommended)
5. **Docker** - Containerization (later sessions)

### Setup Instructions:
Detailed setup instructions are provided in each session directory.

## 🚀 Hands-On Projects
