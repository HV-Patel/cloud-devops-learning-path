### 3. Instance Type and Family
- **Q3.1:** What is an instance type?
- **Q3.2:** What is an instance family?
- **Q3.3:** Explain the difference between:
  - t2.micro vs t3.micro
  - t2.micro vs m5.large
  - t2.micro vs c5.large
- **Q3.4:** What are the main instance families and their use cases:
  - General Purpose (T, M series)
  - Compute Optimized (C series)
  - Memory Optimized (R, X series)
  - Storage Optimized (I, D series)
- **Q3.5:** Which instance type should you choose for this homework and why?

### 4. Key Pair Details

- **Q5.3:** Configure security group with these rules and explain each:
  - Port 22 (SSH) - Source: 0.0.0.0/0
  - Port 80 (HTTP) - Source: 0.0.0.0/0
- **Q5.4:** Why is port 22 needed?
- **Q5.5:** Why is port 80 needed?
- **Q5.6:** Is opening port 22 to 0.0.0.0/0 a security best practice? What would be better?
- **Q5.7:** What does 0.0.0.0/0 mean in CIDR notation?

## Practical Task:

### Launch Your First EC2 Instance

**Instance Specifications:**
- **Name:** MyFirstWebServer-[YourName]
- **AMI:** Amazon Linux 2
- **Instance Type:** t2.micro
- **Key Pair:** Create a new one called "homework-key-[yourname]"
- **Security Group:** Create new with name "web-server-sg"
  - Allow SSH (22) from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
  - Allow HTTP (80) from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
- **Subnet:** Use default public subnet
- **Storage:** Default 8 GB gp2

### Step-by-Step Checklist:
- [ ] Navigate to EC2 Console
- [ ] Click "Launch Instance"
- [ ] Set instance name
- [ ] Select Amazon Linux 2 AMI
- [ ] Choose t2.micro instance type
- [ ] Create new key pair and download .pem file
- [ ] Create new security group with required ports
- [ ] Select public subnet
- [ ] Review and launch instance
- [ ] Wait for instance to reach "Running" state

### Deliverables for Section 1:
1. **Screenshot:** EC2 Dashboard showing your running instance
2. **Screenshot:** Instance details page showing all configurations
3. **Screenshot:** Security group rules
4. **Document:** Answer all questions above
5. **File:** Save your .pem key file securely (don't share it!)
