## üìù Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Create Your Website Content

Before launching the EC2 instance, let's prepare the website content that will be deployed.

**Website Template:** See [`website-template.html`](./website-template.html) for the complete HTML code.

This template includes:
- Responsive design with modern CSS
- Professional gradient background
- Interactive skill cards with hover effects
- Technical project details
- Mobile-friendly layout

### Step 2: Access AWS Management Console

1. **Login to AWS Console:**
   - Go to https://aws.amazon.com/console/
   - Sign in with your AWS account credentials
   - Ensure you're in your preferred region (e.g., us-east-1, us-west-2)

2. **Navigate to EC2 Service:**
   - In the AWS Console search bar, type "EC2"
   - Click on "EC2" from the dropdown
   - You'll be taken to the EC2 Dashboard

### Step 3: Launch EC2 Instance

1. **Start Instance Launch:**
   - Click the orange "Launch Instance" button
   - You'll be taken to the instance launch wizard

2. **Configure Instance Details:**

   **Name and Tags:**
   - Name: `WebServer-Nginx-Project`
   - Add additional tags if needed:
     - Key: `Project`, Value: `CloudTraining`
     - Key: `Environment`, Value: `Development`

   **Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image):**
   - Select "Amazon Linux"
   - Choose "Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM) - Kernel 5.10, SSD Volume Type"
   - Architecture: 64-bit (x86)

   **Instance Type:**
   - Select `t2.micro` (Free tier eligible)
   - 1 vCPU, 1 GiB Memory

   **Key Pair (login):**
   - If you have an existing key pair, select it
   - If not, click "Create new key pair":
     - Name: `webserver-keypair`
     - Key pair type: RSA
     - Private key file format: .pem
     - Click "Create key pair" and download the .pem file
     - Store it securely on your local machine

### Step 4: Configure Network Settings

1. **Network Settings:**
   - VPC: Use default VPC
   - Subnet: Use default subnet (public subnet)
   - Auto-assign public IP: Enable

2. **Security Group Configuration:**
   - Create new security group or edit existing
   - Security group name: `WebServer-SG`
   - Description: `Security group for web server allowing HTTP and SSH`

   **Inbound Rules:**
   - Rule 1: SSH
     - Type: SSH
     - Protocol: TCP
     - Port: 22
     - Source: My IP (for secure access)
   
   - Rule 2: HTTP
     - Type: HTTP
     - Protocol: TCP
     - Port: 80
     - Source: Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
   
   - Rule 3: HTTPS (Optional)
     - Type: HTTPS
     - Protocol: TCP
     - Port: 443
     - Source: Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)

### Step 5: Configure Storage

1. **Storage Configuration:**
   - Root volume: 8 GiB gp2 (General Purpose SSD)
   - Encrypted: No (for this demo)
   - Delete on termination: Yes

### Step 6: Advanced Details - User Data Script

This is the most important part! In the "Advanced Details" section, scroll down to find "User Data" and paste the script from [`user-data.sh`](./user-data.sh).

**Key features of the User Data script:**
- Updates the system packages
- Installs and configures Nginx
- Creates the custom website with professional styling
- Sets up proper file permissions and security headers
- Includes a status monitoring page
- Logs installation progress for troubleshooting

**Script highlights:**
- Automated Nginx installation and configuration
- Custom HTML website deployment
- Security headers implementation
- Status page creation
- Comprehensive logging

### Step 7: Launch the Instance

1. **Review and Launch:**
   - Review all your configurations
   - Click "Launch Instance"
   - Wait for the instance to launch (usually 1-2 minutes)

2. **Monitor Launch Status:**
   - Go to "Instances" in the EC2 dashboard
   - Find your instance named "WebServer-Nginx-Project"
   - Wait for the status to show "Running"
   - Instance State should be "running"
   - Status Checks should show "2/2 checks passed" (may take 2-3 minutes)

### Step 8: Access Your Live Website

1. **Get Public IP Address:**
   - Select your running instance
   - In the details pane below, find "Public IPv4 address"
   - Copy this IP address (e.g., 54.123.45.67)

2. **Access Your Website:**
   - Open a web browser
   - Navigate to: `http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP`
   - You should see your live website!

3. **Test Additional Pages:**
   - Status page: `http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP/status.html`

### Step 9: Verify Installation (Optional)

If you want to SSH into your instance to verify the setup:

1. **Connect via SSH:**
   ```bash
   chmod 400 webserver-keypair.pem
   ssh -i webserver-keypair.pem ec2-user@YOUR_PUBLIC_IP
   ```

2. **Check Nginx Status:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status nginx
   sudo nginx -t
   ls -la /var/www/html/
   ```

3. **View User Data Logs:**
   ```bash
   sudo cat /var/log/user-data.log
   sudo cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
   ```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **Website not loading:**
   - Check security group allows HTTP (port 80)
   - Verify instance is in "running" state
   - Ensure public IP is assigned
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for user data script to complete

2. **SSH connection refused:**
   - Check security group allows SSH (port 22) from your IP
   - Verify you're using correct key pair
   - Ensure key file permissions are 400

3. **Nginx not starting:**
   - SSH into instance and check: `sudo systemctl status nginx`
   - Check logs: `sudo journalctl -u nginx`
   - Verify configuration: `sudo nginx -t`

4. **User Data script issues:**
   - Check cloud-init logs: `sudo cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log`
   - Verify script syntax and permissions

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

- **t2.micro instance**: Free for 750 hours/month (Free Tier)
- **Data transfer**: First 1GB outbound free per month
- **Storage**: 30GB EBS free per month
- **Estimated monthly cost**: $0 (within Free Tier limits)

1. **Terminate EC2 Instance:**
   - Go to EC2 Dashboard ‚Üí Instances
   - Select your instance
   - Instance State ‚Üí Terminate Instance
   - Confirm termination

2. **Delete Security Group (Optional):**
